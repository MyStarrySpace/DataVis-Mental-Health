      <h2 class="p-2">Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the present times, the IT industry is responsible for providing employment to a vast population of the United States. Mental well being of the employees of such a large sector is of utmost importance. To understand the current scenario of mental health in the IT industry, we have referred to the OSMI Mental Health Surveys of Tech Industry. On visualizing these survey responses and drawing meaningful inferences, the stakeholders could gauge how the entire support system for mental health is performing and whether it can be improved further.</p>
      <h2 class="p-2">Data & problem selection</h2>
      <p>The Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) community runs large scale surveys in the Tech industry to gain an understanding of how mental health disorders are viewed in the industry, what provisions and resources are made available by the employer and how effective the entire system is. Each of the surveys consists of about 1500 responses from the employees of the Tech industry that would help the users understand the current employees opinions about how mental health conditions affect the workplace environment.
      </p>
      <p>We have used survey results for the years 2014, 2016 and 2019. This forms an extensive base for us to understand the current statistics of the Tech industry and find corresponding trends and correlations too. The data will be pre-processed to make it adaptable for the visualizations. The visualizations are aimed to be interactive and provide multiple views of our survey data. Being in the field of Computer Science, this problem motivates us to understand how mental health is viewed in the IT industry and understand the trends changing over years.

    <h4 class="mb-1">Key Inferences/Insights:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Tech hubs like California, Washington and New York have the largest section of employees with mental disorders, which shows the overall stressful nature of the tech-industry. </li>
      <li> Anxiety Disorder which includes generalized social phobia is the most commonly faced mental disorder within all states over the years </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Suggestions:</b> The mental health volunteers working for this cause can address the issue of anxiety disorder, and suggest solutions to the companies by analyzing viable options to mitigate its effects.

    <h4 class="mb-1">Key Inferences/Insights:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>People having family history of mental illness are more willing to discuss their issues and reach out for help</li>
      <li>Over the years, the tendency to open up about mental illness has increased among the employees </li>
      <li> Employees with no family history of illness show more reservations about discussing it as compared to the ones with a history</li>
      <li> Gender based observation: To do</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Suggestions:</b> The company can organize counselling sessions for their employees, especially for the ones with no family history of illness so that they feel comfortable discussing their issues and finding the solutions.

    <h4 class="mb-1">Key Inferences/Insights:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The most impactful feature on perception of consequence was the availability of sick leave being easy, as it tended to have the 1st or 2nd highest correlation with a "none" response out of all factors.</li> 
      <li> While resources and knowledge of mental health care options decreased perceptions of consequences, they were not as impactful as direct company policies, such as sick leave and anonymity.</li>
      <li>There is a positive correlation between no perception of negative consequences with mental and with physical health, suggeting that workplaces that care about physical health also tend to care more abbout mental health too.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Suggestions:</b> Companies can make their employees feel more comfortable talking about mental health without fearing consequences if they add policies that help protect workers, such as anonymity and availability of sick leave, rather than just educational resources about mental health.

  <h4 class="mb-1">Key Inferences/Insights:</h4>
  <ul>
   <li> Larger companies are more willing to provide mental health benefits on average up until 2019</li>
   <li> Over time more companies have began to provide benefits regardless of size, hinting that companies are realizing that mental health is important</li>
 </ul>

 <div>
  <h4 class="mb-1">Key Inferences/Insights:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Employees tend to be willing to discuss their mental health issues more often when their companies provide mental health support in the health care package.</li>
    <li>There has been an increase in the percentage of companies offering mental health support from year 2016 to 2019. This shows that more companies are becoming aware about providing mental health care benefits.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Suggestions:</b> The visualization enables us to understand the fact that employees becoming more aware and discussing it under professional scenarios needs companies helping them through mental health benefits and setting up a stage for them to discuss their mental health issues.

</div>

<h4 class="mb-1">Key Inferences/Insights:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Protection of anonymity plays a big role in how people percieve there to be negative consequences of discussing illness.
  Employees who think that anonymity is protected/mostly protected are confident that there won't/might not be negative consequences.  </li> 
  <li> In general, many employees believe that discussing mental health issues would have higher negative consequences as compared to discussing physical health issues</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p-2">Challenges and Issues</h2>
<p>Although the data source was consistent, there were some problems associated with data consistencies across data for all three years.
  To do justice to the visulaizations, we point out some of them here along with our efforts to mitigate the issues to make
the visualization as warranted as possible.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li><b> Missing Data:</b> The data was presented in '.csv' format and seemed to have consitsted of many missing values. Wherever required, some of the data was extrapolated by either the mean/median value of that particular row. For some visualization, where the data couldn't be extrapolated, the rows were dropped keeping in mind that this wouldn't cause any low-data bias.</li>
  <li><b> Free-filled Data:</b>The data was collected without pre-defined possible field values for each column. This has led to many different field values for something that represent same original value. For instance, in 2016 data, there are 70 unique genders. In such scenarios,  we tried our best to group up the genders while respecting the participants' answers. We also drop the columns that have custom responses because those are difficult to analyze without going through each response manually.</li>
  <li><b> Missing columns:</b> Some important columns were missing altogether in a particular year's dataset. For instance, the type of disorder was completely missing in 2014's data. This has led us to completely ignore this data in particular visualization for trend analysis. In the 2019 data, there was no column for perception of negative consequences, so instead, we had to infer the data by taking the inverse of the responses for whether participants would be willing to talk to employers about mental health issues.</li>
